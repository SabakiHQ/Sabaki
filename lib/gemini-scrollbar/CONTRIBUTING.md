## Before reporting a bug

If you find something that you believe to be a bug, please 

1. search the [issue tracker][0] for similar issues
2. check out the [master][1] branch and see if the bug still exists there.


## How to report a bug

1. Specify the revision number of the library where the bug occurred
2. Specify your browser version and operating system (i.e. Chrome 23.0.1271.95, Windows 7)
3. Describe the problem in detail. What happened? What did you expect to happen?
4. Provide a small test case (http://jsfiddle.net, http://jsbin.com/, http://codepen.io/, etc). Or if not possible, provide a link to a live version of your application.


## Contributing

1. Get a GitHub account (if you don't have one yet).
2. Fork the project in GitHub.
3. Make changes to your clone of the repository (please *do not* check in the minified version of the library)
4. Submit a pull request.

_If you tried all of the above and still can't fix the bug, or you're not sure you're doing things right, [let us know][0]._
