# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Local changes to v0.52.0 (reference if associated to a pull request)

**Fixed**

- Fix vertex coordinates insertion in edit (`Ctrl+Click`)
  ([#838](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki/issues/838))

- Keep focus in textarea when using edit tools

**Added**

- Configure (most) shortcuts via settings

- Edit mode

  - Minimal language support via settings
    ([#832](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki/issues/832))
  - Spelling context menu with addition to Custom Dictionary

  - Configure default edit tool via settings
  - `Ctrl+Click` on tool icon inserts tool symbol in comment

- Low-Carbon Engine ([#851](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki/issues/851))
  - In settings, `board.analysis_probes` defines a number of probes
  - If 0, the behavior is the same as of v0.52.0
  - Otherwise, the engine obeys a Start/Pause/Deepen paradigm (through `F4`), on
    a per-position basis:
    - Once started, analysis can be paused, but not stopped as of v0.52.0.
    - If paused, the engine does not analyze anymore, but the result of its
      analysis is still available, in particular the heatmap
    - The user can ask for more analysis via `F4`, or pause via `F4`
    - If `board.analysis_probes` is positive, engine pauses automatically after
      that many probes at position; if negavite, user only can pause the engine
    - When nagivating to a position where analysis was paused, engine performs a
      quick single analysis, then pauses again
  - To permit this behavior, `F4` does not expose `Stop Analysis` anymore,
    unless `board.analysis_probes` is 0; user can achieve a purpose that is
    somehow similar to `Stop Analysis` by stopping the engine via its context
    menu.
- Can configure engine:
  - to load at application startup
  - to have a default role when loaded
- Engine icons:

  - player icon is clickable and its layout is available via CSS
  - analyzer icon is clickable and toggles `Show Analysis`

- Provide the territory map if analysis is `kata-analyze`
- Expose an extra setting to open devtools at startup

## [Sabaki v0.30.1][v0.30.1] (2017-04-25)

**Added**

- The game graph has been rewritten from scratch and is now more efficient with
  large game trees without the need to collapse subtrees. The graph is more
  accessible, the nodes have a bigger click surface and dragging the graph can
  go beyond the component.
- The game collection manager includes support for `ngf` and `gib` files. It
  also sports a slick board animation, which is very slick. Did I mention it's
  slick?
- You can assign custom label texts to a vertex on the board by selecting the
  label or number tool and clicking 'Edit Label' in the context menu.
- You can attach two engines to Sabaki and let them play each other while you
  can sip tea comfortably and watch them fight. The GTP console has been
  redesigned so you are able to address both engines separately. It also
  displays (usually) useful `stderr` information from the engines. Command
  autocompletion is more obvious now.
- Drawing with the line/arrow tool makes it clear that drawing over an existing
  line/arrow removes that line/arrow.
- Ability to hide menu bar on Windows and Linux.

**Changed**

- Update to Electron v1.6.7 beta

**Fixed**

- When encoding is not specified, Sabaki tries to infer the encoding from
  content instead of assuming ISO-8859-1 (Thanks to
  [@fohristiwhirl](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl)).
- When `CA` property is missing from an opened file, Sabaki previously saves it
  without correct UTF-8 `CA` property. This results in Sabaki opening these
  files in ISO-8859-1, not correctly displaying text. This is fixed now.
- When attaching engines, Sabaki previously sends the `boardsize` command after
  `clear_board` which technically can result in arbitrary board positions on the
  engine. This is fixed now.
- Other Go software may specify the same property multiple times on a tree node,
  which technically makes the SGF invalid. Sabaki can handle these files now.

## [Sabaki v0.21.0][v0.21.0] (2017-03-30)

**Added**

- Support for Tygem `gib` files and WBaduk `ngf` files (Thanks to

  (Thanks to [@dfannius](https://github.com/dfannius))
- Move annotation context menu on the last played stone (Thanks to
  [@dfannius](https://github.com/dfannius))
