# Engines

You can add Go engines to Sabaki to play offline against an AI opponent. Sabaki then acts as a graphical UI for any Go software that supports [GTP (Go Text Protocol)](https://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/). 

Most of the Go engines support optional parameters to tune their capacities. List of this parameters can be found in engine documentation. 

* [**Leela Zero**](http://zero.sjeng.org/): Download the latest appropriate version for you system (binary and source code available). Then get a network hash file, likely the [best network](http://zero.sjeng.org/best-network) is the one you want. This engine supports analysis as well.

  Arguments: `--gtp -w path/to/weightsfile` 
  
* [**KataGo**](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo): Download the latest appropriate version from releases page for you system  with pretrained models. This engine supports analysis as well.

  Arguments: `gtp -model /path/to/model.txt.gz -config /path/to/gtp_example.cfg`

* [**GNU Go**](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo): There are binaries available for Windows. On Linux and macOS you can compile the engine from source. There are also [binaries for OS X 10.4.3 and above (universal binary) here](http://www.sente.ch/pub/software/goban/gnugo-3.7.11.dmg). 

  Arguments: `--mode gtp`

* [**Pachi**](https://github.com/pasky/pachi): There are binaries available for Windows and Linux. The source code is available to compile the engine.

  Arguments: None

  Arguments: `--gtp` 
  
* [**AQ**](https://github.com/ymgaq/AQ): AQ is an open-source Go engine with level of expert players.
