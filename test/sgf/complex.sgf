thouis: there's no fuseki DB.
Chinitsu: nice!

Kid Icarus: board positions it has 'seen' before 
thouis: Kid Icarus: yes, but only built up of local features
AerialSnack:  M16 seems kind of passive
thouis: So going "off-book" doesn't really cause it any more difficulty.
Pempu: where is this demo relayed from? They are several moves deeped in to the game already

Kid Icarus: did they not explain to Michael Redmond then that there is no database?
AerialSnack: lol
thouis: possibly not.
AerialSnack: So far I have a 70% success rate with predicting moves
thouis: Well, there was the KGS training database, which one of the networks it uses was trained from.
thouis: But probably not in the way most people think about it
Pempu: Is the hardware for alphago the same as in Fan Hui game?
thouis: they've probably spun up more resources.
Pempu: probably...
thouis: And might be running their deeper (stronger, slower) network on it
thouis: but otherwise, I expect about the same.
Kid Icarus: seems like from google's perspective they'd want a commentator that knew a bit of the novelty of the program itself
pagia: I think black get a slightly behind now

thouis: how does AG nigiri?  it doens't have hands
Kid Icarus: maybe its wrangler did
thouis: cheating!

Pedro Páramo: But for real. If Alpha Go wins this I will have to reconsider severely my thoughts on the limits of evolution. Is IA the future and we just defectuous flesh steppingstones of evolution?

tankbard: I'm glad to see Alphago doesn't defy our conventional wisdom by enough that it did something different there
Pempu: Sedol seems a bit nervous
thouis: I would expect AG to read a lot better
arczyx: the hair is the cause
arczyx: i'm sure
arczyx: lol
thouis: Especially in complicated fights, where there are only a few moves to consider.
DemDandelions: computer getting psychological edge already
Shawnxiaoxu: exciting
thouis: the top group's not completely settled, either, I think
KillerDucky: At first I thought this fight would be bad for white but now I'm not sure...

donjuan100: nope
kamoro: For W, I11 connects up his stones. For B, it's too slow.
DemDandelions: i dont get the logic behing n18
dneg: b still have left corner
darkplayah: man this is *really* complicated
yuri: had to turn off the stream. the mixture between professional analysis and explanation of the rules of the game was driving me crazy
dneg: 3-3 later or use some aji but gotta keep sente
Pempu: N18 makes a bit of eye space and protects against L16 L17 M17 cut
thouis: DemDandelions: making eye space, I Think
AerialSnack: n18 gives black eye space and takes away white territory at the same time
Zal: Doesnt N18 just establish some shape for territory
yuri: isn't it tempting to take the center stones?
DemDandelions: ok, thanks 
yuri: f17 wasn't happy anyways

AerialSnack: They talked about that. There's a few theories they gave
tankbard: 48 WJ18, 49 BP18, 50 WN8, 51 BM7
AerialSnack: Both because Fan Hui played passively, and since Fan Hui was weaker, AG didn't need to fight

llirret: just mute it LOL
tankbard: I like how they haven't actually defined an eye yet
thouis: filthy casuals, as we call them
Bronze: i'm assuming that an eye is capturing a single stone?

acTane: helps upper left but 3-3 still live
AerialSnack: I mean, those two stones were already dead?
Pempu: They are going to undo :)
thouis: AG operator's probably all "wtf are you doing machine?"

yuri: a bit?
DemDandelions: i like how they talk about a move they dont show
AerialSnack: Oh yeah, it was a bit slow
Pempu: G13 removed aji from top left corner. Now it's all white's territory
tankbard: I wanna hear some sass
yuri: nothing left in the corner pempu?
mark5000: Chris: "We can introduce a new word" Mike: "Thick? Or slow?
thouis: If white thinks it's able to survive, and definitely up, solidifying the top makes some sense.
mark5000: Chris: "tenuki"
madswirljh: this actually doesn't seem that bad to me

CylonBunny: New josrki? I have seen this move beffore
AerialSnack: I mean, it doesn't seem weak

DemDandelions: sepuku
YSR43: someone needs to hit alpago on head 
arczyx: will AG play more recklessly if it's behind?
quuxman: some bots just start playing ridiculously when they can't find a winning path
YSR43: so it can be fixed
arczyx: or just play normally all the time?
AerialSnack: white can still get the bottom right though
chauncey: monte carlo bots usually win small and lose spectacularly, alphago probably plays like that too
Pedro Páramo: It is wednesday my dudes
AerialSnack: If it gets sente
thouis: quite possibly.  safe moves that lead to a loss will quickly die out in the tree
Bronze: is alpha go actually losing right now? still seems like it could go either way
mark5000: I don't think this is the monte carlo case though. It seems AG over-estimates the position for itself
thouis: if it thought it was losing, it would probably resign.
AerialSnack: It looks like white is winning, but black has a lot of potential to come back, so even
thouis: mark5000: what do you mean?
yuri: seems like it could conceivably be over in 4-5 moves 
CylonBunny: Does it know how to resign? I'd think that would be the operators job just like finishing moves and passing
DemDandelions: i guess they could have some kind of go expert that could press the resign button before AG ridicules itself
YSR43: @bronze, it doesn't seem like white could secure more than black at the moment

thouis: how strong is Crazy STone?
yuri: can a dan comment? is crosscut really a good move here?
thouis: AG = cut cut cut
YSR43: around 1~3 level i think
YSR43: 1~3 dan
AerialSnack: Crosscut seems okay since white is locally stronger
thouis: 6 stones weaker than AG?
mark5000: It's 6d. At the level I'm running it, 3d
CylonBunny: AG went from passive to super aggressive. Google turned it to 11 I think
chauncey: maybe it thinks it's behind
Traveller: Likely
pagia: Is Alphago making a sabaki?
AerialSnack: Oh god, I was going to go to bed 45 minutes ago, I seriously have to go.
thouis: after that crosscut?
tankbard: LIES

YSR43: yea black can just reduce ~10 by 3-3
Karet: This seems to strengthen white and prepare for the attack against bottom-right
lemmata: It would be interesting to see pro commentary. Myungwan said that AlphaGo actually has "intuition" of some sort.
kamoro: The original stream was talking about how important sente is. But isn't it less important here? Both upper right and lower left are big. If B takes one, W takes the other or vice versa.

Adarain: pretty much 50-50
DemDandelions: oh...
Bronze: the dan9 bet that alphago would win 1 game
quuxman: but B's huge chunk in bottom middle makes up for losses on the right side
Adarain: my personal bet was alphago wins the first game and then lee wins everything else, but my layman opinion is that black is winning here

mark5000: Speaking personally, I slightly favor black.
zemotion: on chinese stream ke jie said that lee wins 
mark5000: Lower center is huge for B

dingrite1: but they arent using self-play just to improve the policy network, they are keeping that data to later train the next generation of the scoring net - hence the massive improvement
Traveller: I'd hate to see the time run out
Manslay: white is not that much ahead actually... but theres no chance black could catch up
bmc: chauncey I don't think that's true in this case
chauncey: it should scale logarithmically but logarithmic growth is extremely slow
apetresc: Traveller, there's byo-yomi so don't worry :)
Traveller: You get to a limit based on the scoring algorithm
phil.bordelon: Been sitting and watching people chat here about AlphaGo and wishing I could talk more about how it works :p
bmc: there's no reason self-play and reinforcement learning would stop getting stronger
tanerr: AlphaGO please beat the left guy, i dont want to hear him!
Traveller: Just throughing more iron doesn't help enough
Traveller: throwing
dingrite1: you cant say logarithmic when the dataset is constantly evolving. but we dont have access to deepmind so we can just speculate
darkplayah: right, but 100x as many GPUs was still a significant Elo advantage. At this level I think it can make the difference.
darkplayah: I think it was decisive in reading really far into those weird moves
trohde: Myungwan allegedly said for the 2nd time that Ali is stronger than he is
chauncey: they saw a very small improvement in Elo for distributed alphago, 100x more GPUs would not be a very big difference
chauncey: watch for another paper soon
tankbard: Still haven't seen AG in a ko fight
Manslay: really?
dingrite1: it can read into local space probably very deeply, thats the sort of thing they didnt do in their paper but should have.

Tarot: For some strange reason, this game seemed easy to understand for the high sdk. Usually, pro games have several areas that are mystifying. I think perhaps game 2 will be of the mystifying type.
Tarot: I predicted AlphaGo 4-1 over Sedol. Now, due to AlphaGo learning from Sedol's play, there is little hope for the human. 
Tarot: AlphaGo: 5-0
